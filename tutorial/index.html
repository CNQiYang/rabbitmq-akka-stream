        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        This project aims to show that reactive Akka Streams can provide a very pleasant way of working with RabbitMQ.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are assuming some basic knowledge of RabbitMQ. Otherwise you wouldn't probably be here. 
        But if this is one of these rare cases then please look closer at this cool piece of technology here <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">http://www.rabbitmq.com/</a> . 
        </p>
        <p>
        You should have a RabbitMQ server installed locally with a management plug-in.
        </p>
        <p>
        The scenario for this project is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code>Queue --> Akka Stream --> Exchange</code></pre>
        <p>
        So what we're going to do, is to consume messages from a Rabbit queue, process it through 
        Akka Stream and finally publish it back to another Rabbit exchange.
        </p>

        <h2>Explore</h2>
        <p>
        After running the app, go RabbitMQ management console at <a href="http://localhost:15672/">http://localhost:15672/</a> , 
        find an exchange named <strong>rabitAkkaStreamInboundExchange</strong> and start publishing messages.
        </p>
        <p>
        You should observe two effects:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>Your message will be printed to a console,
        <li>A queue named <strong>rabbitAkkaStreamOutboundQueue</strong> will contain a slightly modified version of your message.
        </ol>
        <p>
        You will notice that messages containing the word 'terror' will not go to the outbound queue. This is a censorship filter 
        implemented on purpose. Feel free to modify the "forbidden words" list, but we insist you do not remove the filter entirely. 
        Otherwise unexpected things can happen - censorship is very important.

        <h2>Consuming, processing, publishing</h2>
        <p>
        Below you will find the main steps for this whole process.
        </p>
        <h3>Consuming messages</h3>
        <p>
        <code>RabbitConsumer</code> class is responsible for initializing a channel to the queue and registering 
        a consumer for that queue. It exposes <code>Flow[RabbitMessage]</code> 
        object that gives you the stream if incoming rabbit messages you can work with.
        </p>
        <h3>Processing messages</h3>
        <p>
        To split the work into logical parts we are declaring the processing as a function of <code>Flow[RabbitMessage] =&gt; Flow[String]</code>.
        </p>
        <h3>Publishing back to RabbitMQ</h3>
        <p>
        <code>RabbitPublisher</code> is, again, responsible for initializing an outgoing channel. 
        The <code>Flow[String] =&gt; Flow[Unit]</code> function that it creates, contains logic for publishing message back to RabbitMQ exchange.
        </p>
        <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
        <p>
        After receiving a connection from <code>RabbitConnectionActor</code> we combine these functions and call <code>consume()</code> on the final flow.
        </p>
        <pre><code>(MyDomainProcessing andThen publisherFlow)(consumerFlow).consume(materializer)</code></pre>
    </div>

        <h2>This is it</h2>
        <p>
        You just saw a clean functional way of working with RabbitMQ. There are of course many problems that have to be solved here. 
        This project is just a simple wrapper on the official RabbitMQ client, not a complete solution, but hopefully this is the way we'll be doing things in the future.
